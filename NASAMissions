NASA Missions
An intern's perspective

<p>As an intern at NASA, I am surrounded by fascinating talk about upcoming NASA missions. Even though I'm not directly involved in some of these missions, I can't help but get 
excited about them. During my few weeks here, I've learned an amazing amount of information about NASA missions I didn't even know existed. So I've decided to introduce a series
of posts dedicated to NASA missions as I understand them. I'll cover Moon to Mars, Deep Space Gateway, Artemis, and even
more missions that you may have never heard of! These posts are not meant to be official or expert summaries in any form, but rather
a light read on what we are up to here at NASA.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
