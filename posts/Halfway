<p>I am officially halfway through my internship! What an adventure! To those that have
stuck with me, thank you!</p>
<p>Blog posts have been intermittent lately, mostly because NASA likes to keep me busy! Here's a snapshot 
of what I've been up to lately.</p>
<p>
	<h2>Programming</h2>
		<p>Exactly what I was hired to do! I have been hard at work creating applications for AR devices like the Magic Leap and zSpace
	as well as the immersive CAVE! Each application is different, but they generally showcase a NASA mission or concept. We demonstrate
	these apps during tours of the lab or outreach events.</p>

She&#39;s done a fantastic job illustrating her thoughts and ideas thus far, and she will eventually use her 3D models during outreach! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MagicLeap?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MagicLeap</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NASAIntern?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NASAIntern</a> <a href="https://t.co/vjyd1wONIm">pic.twitter.com/vjyd1wONIm</a></p>&mdash; NASA GVIS Lab (@NASA_GVIS) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA_GVIS/status/1181944562065035267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2019</a></blockquote>

	<h2>Presenting</h2>
		<p>One of the most important part of the creative process is communicating your work to others. At this point, I've given so
	many presentations that they hardly phase me. Just last week, all the interns gave a midterm presentation of their progress
	so far(even interns can't escape midterms!). Most of my presentations happen in the GVIS Lab, where we give tours of our facility weekly.</p>
	<h2>And a <i>lot</i> of outreach</h2>
		<p>Interacting with the community is a priority within the GVIS Lab! We visit schools, host events, and
		bring our demonstrations to public venues weekly. Every Friday, we even partner with a local high school to host NASA club, where
		we lead activites relating to data science, robotics, and the fusion of art and technology. </p>
