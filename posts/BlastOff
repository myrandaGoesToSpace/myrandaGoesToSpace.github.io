Blast Off: An introduction

After weeks of anticipation, I've finally arrived in Cleveland, Ohio, ready to start my new job at the NASA Glenn Research Center. What will I be doing?
Great question. My project for the next sixteen weeks centers around a system called Computer Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE).
For all you Star Trek fans, it seems directly inspired by the renowned Holodeck. CAVE features four to six 4K screens forming a small room (hence - CAVE!)
in which the user immerses him or herself into a fully virtual environment! The Glenn Research Center programs two categories of
simulations for CAVE: explanatory (informing the public about NASA) and exploratory (researching space and other exciting fields). While I don't 
know my specific assignments yet, my first day on the job is sure to be filled with objectives, training, and space puns. Follow and learn with me
as I fulfill every nerd's dream, and check back frequently for updates on my internship, life at NASA, and the world of virtual reality!
