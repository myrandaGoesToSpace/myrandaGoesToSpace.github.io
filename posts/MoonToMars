NASA Missions: Moon to Mars

So far in this NASA missions series, I have covered Artemisz, Deep Space Gateway, and the Mars 2020 Rover. Now I will tie everything together with
one of the most exciting upcoming missions: Moon to Mars. This mission is exactly what it sounds like - NASA is finally taking
astronauts to Mars! As the name suggests, this mission will be paired with the Artemis mission to the moon.
