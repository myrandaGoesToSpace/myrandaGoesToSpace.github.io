Happy Internsgiving!
A big thank you to my support team

<p>Happy Thanksgiving from the interns at Glenn! Although we’re away from our families, we celebrated our NASA family together with Internsgiving this holiday. </p>

<p>When you’re surrounded in an environment with like-minded people, it’s easy to forget how special an opportunity you have. It’s tempting for me to let working at NASA become the new “normal.” I hope I never lose my gratitude for the position I have here.</p>

<p>In addition, I am incredibly thankful for every single reader and supporter of my internship this semester. Thank you for giving me the confidence to pursue my dreams and the inspiration to document them! </p>
