NASA Missions: Mars 2020 Rover
Red rover, red rover, send your names over

<p>While NASA gears up for the mission to the moon and beyond, the space agency is also sending out another Mars Rover. Largely 
based on the Curiosity Rover that has explored the Martian terrain since 2012, the new rover is a car-sized robotic science lab.
The rover will test samples of Martian soil, capture pictures of the landscape, and even search for signs of ancient life on the 
dusty planet. One new feature of this rover is its ability to package soil samples and cache them for pickup by later Mars missions.
These samples could then be transported back to Earth for more specialized analysis. The new rover is scheduled to launch 
from Earth in 2020 and land on the surface of Mars by February 2021. </p>

<p>And you can go with it! NASA is offering everyone the opportunity
to fly their names onboard with the Mars 2020 Rover! During its mission, the rover will carry a silicon chip containing the names
of millions of aspiring space cadets. Those who <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/participate/send-your-name/mars2020/"submit</a> 
their names will even receive a boarding pass for the trip!</p>

<p>NASA is not only accepting the names of virtual passengers - the rover needs a name, too! NASA has invited students from kindergarten through high 
school to name the Mars 2020 Rover. If you are a K-12 student, submit your name idea along with a short (150 words) essay about why
your name should be chosen. The winner will not only name the NASA rover but will also get to watch the rover launch from Cape Canaveral 
in Florida. Submit those names <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/participate/name-the-rover/">here</a> before November 1st.</p>

<p>Personally, I hope it's named Hindsight.</p>
